Chunk 18:
We are proud to announce that the Bachelor of 
Software Engineering programme of the OUSL 
is the first -ever UGC approved, industry -
oriented software engineering programme 
offered by a local university.  
Software Engineering has become one of the 
major computing disciplines today. In the early 
days, it was a discipline within Computer 
Science. Over the years it has evolved to what 
it is today an d gained prominence as the 
foundation of all software systems. The Joint 
Task Force of The IEEE Computer Society and 
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 
after several years of research, has developed 
guidelines for such degrees, and today these 
guidelines are used worldwide for developing 
Software Engineering degree programmes.  
Software Engineering is the discipline where 
you learn to design, develop and maintain 
software systems that are reliable and efficient 
while satisfying the requirements of th e 
customers. Software Engineers usually solve

Chunk 19:
while satisfying the requirements of th e 
customers. Software Engineers usually solve 
problems for customers in different domains 
outside software engineering – engineering, 
natural science, social science, finance, 
business and other similar fields.

Chunk 20:

 The primary focus of the programme is to 
produce well qualified , industry -ready 
graduates - Software Engineers - to work in the 
software industry. To this end, the programme 
contains a significant number  of practical 
components and provides students the 
opportunity to work alongside software 
industr y professionals.  
Why pursue a BSEHons degree ? 
According to recent industry surveys, there is a 
huge demand for IT specialists in Sri Lanka and 
in the rest of the world. Software engineering 
has become a major recruitment criterion  in 
today’s software indu stry. Hence having such 
an academic qualification will make your future 
in this industry much brighter. At OUSL, a 
reputed National University in Sri Lanka, you 
have an excellent opportunity to earn a well -
recognised degree that is well suited for the 
software industry. After successful completion 
of the BSEHons degree, you can work either in 
the software industry or in a division of an

Chunk 21:
of the BSEHons degree, you can work either in 
the software industry or in a division of an 
institution where design, development and 
maintenance of software are undertaken.  
About programme design  
In developing this programme,  we have 
followed the guidelines provided by the Joint 
Task Force formulated by two leading computer 
associations in the world – IEEE Computer 
Society and ACM. In addition, we have 
considered the demand and expectations of the 
IT sector in Sri Lanka. While developing the 
curriculum and the courses in the programme, 
we have had the participation and untiring 
efforts of professionals from reputed software companies and academics qualified in the 
software engineering field.  The cur riculum is 
continuously updated considering prevailing 
software industry requirements as well as 
embedding new developments in the discipline 
of software engineering. Next major curriculum 
revision  will be effective from the academic 
year 2025/2026.

Chunk 22:
revision  will be effective from the academic 
year 2025/2026.  
On the  other hand, it has been recognised that 
while engaged in studies, working alongside 
software professionals is essential in order to 
become a good software engineering graduate. 
To achieve this objective, students have to work 
in the software industry. Acc ordingly, the Sri 
Lanka Association of Software and Service 
Companies (SLASSCOM) facilitates students 
to secure placements in the software industry. 
The SLASSCOM acts as the catalyst of growth 
for the Sri Lankan IT and BPO industry by 
facilitating trade an d business, propagation of 
education and employment, encouragement of 
research and innovation.

 Credit Rating  
Each course is also assigned a credit rating, 
reflecting the academic value of the course and 
the amount of time a student is expected to 
devote to that course. The total effective time 
expected to be spent by an average student for a 
course in which the a cademic value is one credit is about 50 notional hours  of study time. At the 
OUSL, the maximum number of credits a 
student can offer per academic year is limited to 
thirty eight  (38).  
The completion of minimum 130 credits is 
needed to complete the BSE Hons  Degree.

 All curricula for programmes offered by OUSL will be revised every 5 years. Therefore, 
current BSEHons curriculum may change in 2025-2026. However, students can obtain the 
degree award with the current curriculum for 3 more years starting 202 4-2025.   
Minor changes to few Level 3 courses and many changes for pre -requisites will be enacted 
from 202 5/202 6 and new compulsory courses will be offered.  
 
Prerequisites  
To offer courses one has to satisfy the 
prerequisites for each course. T hese pre -
requisites are given in the above Table.  
 
Industrial placements  
It is mandatory for you to complete a 
minimum period of 6 month Full -Time 
industrial training  at a software company. 
From this placement, students gain on -site 
experience by working alongside professionals 
and the opportunity to observe good practices as 
well as developing necessary skills to work as a 
software engineer.  
The Department is working closely with the Sri

Chunk 50:
software engineer.  
The Department is working closely with the Sri 
Lanka Association for Software and Service 
Companies (SLASSCOM) to give you an 
opportunity to do your training in the best 
software companies in the country. 
SLASSCOM has informed its member 
companies to offer training placements for 
OUSL students. The University facilitates the 
process by forwarding student CVs to a number 
of companies through SLASSCOM. The actual 
selection criteria are decided by the companies 
themselves. Generally, this involves a technical 
test and/or an interview.  SLASSCOM also uses the Future Careers 
Bridge Challenges 
(https://www.futurecareersbridge.net/ ) to 
introduce the basic ICT skills required by the 
Software Industry.  This program is also used 
by SLASSC OM to evaluate prospective 
trainees and employees.  All students are 
strongly encouraged to register and begin the 
Basic Challenges as they will prepare you for 
the BSE Hons  program.

Chunk 51:
Basic Challenges as they will prepare you for 
the BSE Hons  program.  
 
Alternatively, if you are already employed or 
have found a training place ment on your own at 
a company, discuss with the Manager/CITES. If 
the credentials of the company are acceptable to 
the University, you will be allowed to carry out 
training at the company. To claim an exemption 
for the training course based on the working 
experience you have. you need to register for 
the course EEX5811 industrial Training.

 Study system  
The Open University of Sri Lanka conducts the 
study programmes in distance mode with a 
strong emphasis on the multimedia instructional 
materials, printed materials and audio -visual 
aids. The Faculty of Engineering Technology is 
a pioneer in the world in de livering engineering 
courses in the distance mode.   
Prospective students should understand that the 
Open University DOES NOT conduct regular 
Lectures as in traditional institutions.  Students 
are expected to engage in SELF -LEARNING 
guided  by the instructi onal material provided.   
 
The central element of self -study is the online 
class in the Moodle Learning Management 
System (LMS) and the Study Guides produced 
by the University, which provide a series of 
carefully designed activities and self -
assessment que stions in order to develop critical 
and creative thinking abilities. In addition, day 
schools (face -to-face sessions/online interactive

Chunk 53:
schools (face -to-face sessions/online interactive 
sessions), laboratory work and seminars will be 
held.  
Pre-scheduled day schools are conducted by the 
academic staff of the Faculty of Engineering 
Technology, Academic staff of CITES and 
professionals from the industry. These day 
schools provide the opportunity for the students 
to discuss the issues encountered in self -
learning of a particular course. Facilities 
available f or self -learning, such as library 
facilities, Audio -Visual Resource Centre, 
elementary computer labs, and more can be 
found in the section Student Services .  
The online classrooms in the Learning 
Management System, play a vital role in the 
distance educati on programmes offered by the 
university. Each course offered in this study 
programme has an online classroom which 
provides access to every registered student over 
the web. Following are some of the benefits of 
an online classroom:  
● access to the latest cou rse information

Chunk 54:
an online classroom:  
● access to the latest cou rse information 
and learning resources  
● prompt feedback from the course 
coordinators  
● peer learning through active 
participation in group discussions 
happening in the classroom  
● online submission of coursework.  
We recommend strongly that all students make 
arrangements to have regular access to a 
computer - as many subjects will involve 
programming.   Furthermore, having access to a 
computer will become a necessity during 
training and internship.  
 
The OUSL facilitates lifelong learning. 
Therefore, the program mes offered by OUSL 
open  avenues for everyone, especially for 
employed persons. Thus,  the University makes 
every effort to schedule activities during the 
weekends and public holidays as far as possible. 
However, certain activities such as laboratory 
sessio ns and examinations  may have to be 
scheduled during weekdays . Especially,  on-
site Continuous Assessment Tests and Final

Chunk 55:
scheduled during weekdays . Especially,  on-
site Continuous Assessment Tests and Final 
Examinations will be held during weekdays.

Chunk 56:
27 
 Since the activity schedule is given to the 
students at the beginning of the academic year, 
we expect you to plan your work well in 
advance.  
Course Activities  
Each course has different activities. Tutor 
Marked Assignments (TMAs), Laboratory 
Work, Mini Projects, Case Studies, Presentation 
Sessions, Online Quizzes (OQs) and 
Continuous Assessm ent Tests (CATs) are 
some. The activities would depend on the 
course requirements.  
Assessment  
Each course in a programme of study is 
assessed separately. Assessment consists of two 
components, namely Continuous Assessment 
and Final Examination. The purpose  of the 
continuous assessment is to facilitate student 
learning, which involves activities such as 
TMAs, laboratory work, Mini Projects, Case 
Studies, Presentation sessions, OQs, and CATs.  
 
Except for Mathematics courses, all other 
courses will have at lea st one CA component 
that is assessed by a viva voce/ (face to face 
interview online/onsite).

Chunk 57:
that is assessed by a viva voce/ (face to face 
interview online/onsite).  
 
Eligibility to sit Final examinations - You must 
obtain at least 40% for Overall Continuous 
Assessment Mark (OCAM)  to get eligibility to 
sit Final exam. Differen t courses have 
different formulae to calculate the OCAM.  
  
 Example - EEX3467  
If MP >= 40 then  
X = B(CAT, OQ)* 0.2+ MP * 0.3+ LAB -
EV*0.3 + AVG(TMA)*0.2;  
If MP< 40 then X = 0;  
Two conditions  that need to meet  for eligibility 
are X >=40 and MP >= 40  
  
Here X is the OCAM, MP is the Mini -Project 
Mark, B(CAT,OQ) means the best of CAT 
mark or the Online Quiz Mark, LAB -EV is Lab 
Evaluation, AVG(TMA) is the average of Tutor 
Marked Assignment (TMA)  
 
In some courses like EEI3262 - the critical 
component is Lab Tests. Average Lab test 
marks for 4 lab tests must be > = 40  to gain 
eligibility.  
  
Very important  - there are strict deadlines for 
submission of Mini project reports, design

Chunk 58:
Very important  - there are strict deadlines for 
submission of Mini project reports, design 
reports etc. Late submissions are not accepted. 
Even if you bring an excellent Mini -project 
report after the deadline it will not be accepted.  
Since there are 6 -7 courses per seme ster, final 
deadline for submission will be scattered. Just 
because there is more time before the Eligibility 
due date, deadlines will not be extended, and 
you will have to repeat the course if the required 
assessments are not submitted on time. You are 
strongly advised to make a  summary 
timetable of submission dates at the 
beginning of the course and stick to the 
stipulated deadlines.

Chunk 59:
28 
 To sit Final examination , a student must 
apply for the Final exam through MyOUSL 
portal and get a pass mark for OCAM. Al l 
Final examinations will be done on -site 
during weekdays as well as weekends.  
Awarding of the Degree  
In order to gain the degree, students have to 
fulfil the minimum credit requirements in each 
category and obtain 130 credits altogether from 
level 3 and a bove. However, students cannot 
claim credits over the maximum limit for each 
category and should obtain credits subject to the 
restrictions for levels and categories of the 
courses. This has been summarised in Table 1.  
The credit requirement for the Higher  Diploma 
is summarised in Table 2.  
Degrees are awarded either with First Class, 
Second Class (Upper), Second Class (Lower) or 
Pass. The applicable class will be decided 
according to the Grade Point Average (GPA  
) which is computed using the grades obtained  
for the courses and their credit ratings as shown 
in the Appendix 2.

Chunk 60:
for the courses and their credit ratings as shown 
in the Appendix 2.  
Grade Point Average (GPA)  
The GPA shall be computed by considering the 
courses at levels 4, 5, and 6 totalling to  70 
credits. In selecting the courses for 70 
credits the following sequen ce will be 
followed.  
(1) Compulsory courses at levels 5 and 6  
(2) Elective courses at levels 5 and 6 
(3) Compulsory courses at level 4  In a situation, where exactly seventy (70) 
credits cannot be obtained, the courses are 
selected to the nearest value bel ow seventy (70), 
and the remainder credit is taken as a Part Credit 
of the next course.  
The Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed as 
follows.
